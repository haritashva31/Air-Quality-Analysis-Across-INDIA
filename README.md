# Air-Quality-Analysis-Across-INDIA
Welcome to our Air Quality Monitoring Project, a pivotal initiative focused on comprehensively understanding and addressing the impact of pollutants on human health and the environment. Through a robust data pipeline, we collect and validate raw air quality data from various sources, storing it seamlessly in MongoDB. Utilizing Spark for distributed processing and PowerBI for analysis, we delve into key pollutants such as PM2.5, NOx, CO, and others, aiming to provide stakeholders with actionable insights for informed decision-making and sustainable living environments.

Data Ingestion:
Source Variety: Raw air quality data from sensors and monitoring stations is collected and validated to ensure adherence to predefined standards.

Dashboard Creation: PowerBI's features are employed to create interactive dashboards, providing stakeholders with a user-friendly view of air quality trends.


Air Quality Monitoring: Understanding Key Pollutants

PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5):
Significance: Fine particles impacting respiratory and cardiovascular health.
Importance: Critical pollutant with direct human health implications.

PM10 (Particulate Matter 10):
Significance: Larger particles affecting respiratory and cardiovascular health.
Importance: Significant, especially in regions with elevated coarse particulate matter levels.

NO (Nitric Oxide) and NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide):
Significance: Respiratory irritants; NO2 linked to respiratory issues and smog.
Importance: Significant in urban areas with high vehicular traffic.

NOx (Nitrogen Oxides):
Significance: Various nitrogen oxides contributing to air pollution.
Importance: Essential for understanding overall nitrogen oxide impact on air quality.

SO2 (Sulphur Dioxide):
Significance: Causes respiratory irritation and contributes to acid rain.
Importance: Significant in areas with industrial activities or sulphur-containing fuel combustion.

CO (Carbon Monoxide):
Significance: Harmful gas interfering with oxygen transport.
Importance: Critical in enclosed spaces and regions with heavy traffic or industrial processes.

Ozone (O3):
Significance: Ground-level ozone causing respiratory issues.
Importance: Crucial, especially in urban areas with high photochemical activity.

Benzene:
Significance: Volatile organic compound causing nervous system damage and carcinogenic effects.
Importance: Vital to monitor, especially in areas with industrial activities or heavy traffic.


Project Significance Summary:
This air quality monitoring project is of paramount importance, addressing pollutants directly impacting human health and the environment. Focusing on key contaminants enables a comprehensive understanding of air quality, facilitating the development of targeted interventions and policies for healthier, sustainable living environments.
